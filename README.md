# AC-Typer
If you're tired of typing all your Nook Codes manually, I’ve got you covered! AC Typer does it for you - just run the program, enter your code, and it will type it out automatically.


How to Use

1 Open ac_type.exe (or use the .bat file if the .exe doesn’t work).

2 Type in your Nook Code (make sure there are no spaces — it should be a single continuous line).

3 In-game, talk to Nook and tell him you want to enter a code.

4 In Dolphin Emulator, switch the controller to Xbox 360.

5 Press your keybind (default is J) to start.

6 Wait until it’s finished typing.



If you run into issues, read the "README.txt" file first.

If you’re still having problems, reach out to me on Discord: lumixus1
