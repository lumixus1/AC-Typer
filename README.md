# AC-Typer
If you're tired of typing all your Nook Codes manually, I’ve got you covered! AC Typer does it for you - just run the program, enter your code, and it will type it out automatically.


HOW TO USE IT:

-Open ac_type.exe (or use the bat file if the exe doesnt work)
-Type in the nook code (make sure that it doesnt have any spaces. it should be a straight line)
-Go to nook in game and tell him u want to tell him a code
-Switch in dolphin emulator the controller to xbox360
-Press the keybind you have set (default J) to start
-Wait till its done
