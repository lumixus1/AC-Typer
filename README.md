# AC Type - Animal Crossing Nook Code Tool

A tool for automatically typing Nook Codes in Animal Crossing. Works with Dolphin Emulator and supports both German and English keyboard layouts.

## Requirements
- Windows 10/11
- Dolphin Emulator

## Installation


- Install the zip in the releases
- Unzip it
- Run the bat file
- Enter the code in the text field in the programm
- Go to tom nook and say you want to tell him a code
- Make sure that in Dolphin Emulator "Xinput/0/Gamepad" is selected (if that doesnt work try with the xbox360)
- Make sure that in Animal Crossing, you have the lowercase letter keyboard and you can type in the code
- Click "Start Typing" or press F1 to begin

## TROUBLESHOOTING

If the program doesn't start:
- Make sure all files are in the same folder
- Try running as Administrator (right-click > Run as Administrator)
- Check if Windows Defender/antivirus is blocking it
- Install ViGEmBus driver if you get gamepad errors

If you see errors:
- Check "ac_type_error.log" file in this folder
- Make sure you have administrator rights (for keyboard access)

if it starts typing but it doesnt detect the Inputs in Dolphin

- Move the xbox.ini into "C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Dolphin Emulator\Config\Profiles\GCPad" if the GCPad folder doesnt exist, just create it. If the Profile folder isnt showing then u have to make a profile first.: 
	-in dolphin emulator press on controller
	-then next to port 1, press on configure
	-in the upper right you should see an input field with a load, save and delete button
	-type "xbox" into the input field then press on save
	-the profile folder should now pop up and you should now be able to overwrite the current xbox profile.

if it starts typing something wrong

-Make sure that before you press start, your ingame keyboard is on lowercase letter
-Make sure that you selected the right keyboard language (if your language isnt there, select "english". If it still doesnt work reach me out on discord: lumixus1)
